If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a 
file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. 
A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. 
Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function 
below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?


def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = filesize//block_size
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = filesize%block_size
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return block_size*(full_blocks+1)
    return block_size*full_blocks

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
